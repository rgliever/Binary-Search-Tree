# Binary-Search-Tree
A simple user input insertion/deletion BST in C++

This program allows insertion and deletion of nodes in a binary search tree by user input.
Input 'i ' followed by an integer to insert a node with that value into the BST.
Input 'd ' followed by an integer to delete the first occurence of a node with that value from the BST.
The BST is printed automatically after each insertion/deletion. The left subtree is printed before the right subtree.
Input 'check' to see if the tree is a BST (should always be true ;])
Input 'q' to quit the program.
